# Lesson 8

### Perceptron
The basic unit of a neural network. In simple words, perceptron = neuron.

### Intro to neural network. Logistic Regression
In this part of the study, we analyse the criteria of acceptance at a university. It depends of two factors (the Grade and the Test of a student). But, wich one is more important? Well... the neural network will learn about it for itself. It does this with something called **weights.**

While the neural network get more training, it modify the values of the weights. Each input has a weight associated. If the final weight is near to one it means that the corresponding input is very important. If the weight is near to zero, then the corresponding input is less important. In an extreme case, if a weight is equal to zero, the input has not insidence on the neural network. No mater the value of the input, it will not affect the output of the NN (neural network).

Then I encourage you to learn more about **weights, summation and activation functions, [Heavyside step function] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function), bias**
