# Semana 2
En esta parte trabajamos para crear una red neuronal b√°sica. El environment en Anaconda:
- conda create -n my-neural-network python=2
- conda install numpy

### Numpy
Numpy is an excellent library for numerical computations in Python. Here are a few resources to familiarize yourself with Numpy:
- [Numpy official tutorial.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html)
- [CS231N Numpy tutorial.](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

### Matrix Math and NumPy Refresher (Lesson 7)
In this lesson, you'll review the matrix math you'll need to understand to build your neural networks. 
You'll also explore NumPy, the library you'll use to efficiently deal with matrices in Python.
